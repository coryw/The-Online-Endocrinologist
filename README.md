# The-Online-Endocrinologist
An online patient-to-doctor communication system
## About this project
This is a simple Laravel application I created for a school project. It is in
pre-alpha but I will be making additions and improvements gradually.
## Deployment
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `composer update` in the root directory to download the vendor files
	- Optional: run `composer require filp\whoops` for detailed debugging
3. Rename `env.example` to `.env` and set database settings etc.
